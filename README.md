**OSINTDroid** is a Bash-based Android forensic tool developed by **Fresh Forensics**. It allows you to quickly extract and analyze various types of data from an Android device using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). The tool is designed for **educational purposes, privacy awareness, and mobile forensics demonstrations**.
